    <p> Electric vehicles are helping nations combat climate change 
        by reducing use of fossil fuels in the transportation sector. 
        Electric vehicles as you guessed it uses electrical energy as 
        its fuel. Energy storage or batteries are used for storing 
        electrical energy and electric motor is used to convert 
        electrical energy into mechanical energy. As more and more customers start to use electric vehicles, 
        power networks will see an increase in energy consumption 
        in the form of electric vehicle charging. Customers may choose 
        to charge their electric vehicle either in their home or 
        in charging stations. </p>
      
    <p> In EVOLVE, electric vehicles eneregy cosumption is modeled based on type and number of electric 
      vehicles. The data used to model consumption is taken from region in India. So if you are using this tool 
      to model electric vehicles in a different region some parameters need to be tweaked in the model. Please reach out to NREL team if 
      you need support tweaking these parameters.
