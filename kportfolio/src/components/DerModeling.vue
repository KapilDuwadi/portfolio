    <p>Electric vehicles are new type of electrical loads and understanding their consumption pattern allows utilities design policies for demand side management and many more. EVOLVE has in built python module that allows user to generate synthetic profiles based on number and type of electric vehicles.</p>
    <p>Solar output from a solar installation depends on many factors such as irradiance, panel orientation, panel efficiecy etc. EVOLVE implements simplified solar modeling to compute solar output profile for a given size of PV installation.</p>
    <p>Energy storage plays a vital role in distributed energy resource (DER) integration in distribution feeder. EVOLVE has in built storage model that user can interact with for different charging/discharging strategies (e.g time based, power based, price based). It also has in built algorithm to determine best storage capacity as well as charging/discharging thresholds.</p>
