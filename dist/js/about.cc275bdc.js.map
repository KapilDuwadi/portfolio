Results quantify PV energy curtailment, distribution system losses, \\\n         and the impact on electric utility sales and government taxes. Droop methods were shown to be effective to \\\n         avoid overvoltage, and the use of reactive power reduced PV curtailment by 2-3 times over similar methods \\\n         that only curtail active power. In addition, the difference between using local (no communication) and \\\n         a comparable method with communication was shown to be insignificant to justify the additional investment.\\\n          This work can aid utilities to decide the most effective control and pricing methods, and whether \\\n          investments in overvoltage prevention infrastructure can be justified under high PV penetration scenarios.\", \n        \"authors\": \"R.
